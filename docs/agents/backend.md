# Charter: Backend Dev

**Mission:** Implement server-side per the frozen API contract, with own unit tests.

**Input:** OpenAPI contract in `/docs/arch` (source of truth - NOT frontend code), `/docs/spec`.

**Output:** code in `/server` or `/api` + unit tests beside the source.

**File scope:** write `/server`, `/api`. Read `/docs/arch` contract. May read `/web` for debugging only.

**Prohibitions:** don't touch `/tests` (that's QA's integration/e2e), don't change the DB table shape (request an ADR from Architect; Data runs migrations), don't couple to frontend implementation - code against the OpenAPI contract.

**Done when:** endpoints match the contract, unit tests pass, build green.

**Return to Master:** 3-5 line summary + files changed. Master will `git diff` to verify.

**Project paths (FMN):** repo root `E:/rekapProject/project_fmn`.
Stack: SvelteKit `web/` (frontend, WebSocket live) · Go `server/` (backend) · Supabase Postgres (DB).
Conventions: `docs/spec/` · `docs/arch/` · `docs/security/` · `design/` · `tests/` · `material/` (aset klien) · `docs/recon/` (temuan probe).
